# pairwise-molecular-embedding  
## Introduction
    FPtand model uses pairs of molecules as input to embed molecules, and uses text-cnn modeling to predict molecular properties. The model is stored in model8_fp, and the files fa_fp.npy and fd_fp.npy are pairs of molecular data. fp_Y.npy is the target value of molecular properties to be predicted, and fp1.py is the main program code.
## Programs and Files:
FPtand are Experimental code for the model.
## Environment
Configure the environment according to <br>last.yml</br> before running the code.
