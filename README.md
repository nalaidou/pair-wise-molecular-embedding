## Introduction
  Feature engineering is a tricky task in small sample modeling with machine learning algorithms, especially for molecular materials in such a complex solar cell. To save feature engineering in machine learning (ML) modeling for power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), a donor and acceptor(D/A) pairwise molecular embedding representation algorithm is suggested for predicting PCE of OSCs. The generated embedding has been used in popular ML methods, and leads to remarkable performance improvement. The best model (TextCNN) achieved correlation coefficient r (0.89), RMSE (1.29), R2 (0.79) and Q2 (0.81), demonstrating accuracy, goodness of fit and stability of models were satisfactory and significantly better than the baseline models.
