# FPtand（pairwise molecular embedding）  
## Introduction
FPtand is a model using Text-CNN to generate molecular embedding based on donor and acceptor pair data in organic solar cell for predicting power conversion efficiency(PCE). 
<br>The model is stored in **model8_fp**, and the files **fa_fp.npy** and **fd_fp.npy** are training data of acceptor and donor, respectively.
<br>**fp_Y.npy** is the file containing target PCE values, and **fp1.py** is the main program code.
## Programs and Files:
FPtand are python source code for the model.
## Environment
Configuring the environment according to **last.yml** before running the code.
